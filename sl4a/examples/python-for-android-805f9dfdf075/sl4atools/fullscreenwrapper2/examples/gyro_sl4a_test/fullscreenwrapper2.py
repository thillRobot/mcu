class Layout(object):
    '''
    Defines a "screen" with an xml layout that contains views. Layout is a abstract class - you MUST derive your own Layout class.
    
    To use a Layout, you need to first derive a class with Layout as a base class: MyLayout(Layout) and define the functions on_show(self)
    and on_close(self). in your MyLayout.__init__(), you MUST include a call to super(MyLayout,self).__init__(xml, title)
    
    the xml property stores the xml text. This is used by FullScreenWrapper2App.show_layout() to actually display the layout. 
    
    The layout contains importantly a BaseDict called views. A BaseDict is a dict that allows access to members by either [key] or .key

    IMPORTANT: The views BaseDict is populated by FullScreenWrapper2App.show_layout() once the xml is displayed on the screen. Your layout's Views that have an id 
    only become accessible once the xml is displayed & the Layout.on_show() function is caled by the framework. DO NOT try to access views in the __init__() and
    put all your view initialization code & event handler attachment in the on_show() function. 
    
    The views BaseDict allows you to access & modify properties of your views & allows event based interaction. You would typically access view 
    properties as Layout.views.view_id.property with the FullScreenWrapper2 framework making the appropriate SL4A api calls
    to access the property. To set events for the views, use Layout.views.view_id.add_event(EventHandler)

    The FullScreenWrapper2App actually stores layout objects in a stack allowing you to seamlessly the right parent layout on closing a child layout. This
    lets you build a natural interaction using the "back" key. Note however that every time a layout is shown, its views are created afresh & the Layout.views 
    BaseDict is cleared & re-populated and the Layout.on_show() function is called. This is why you should put all your view initialization & event handler setup
    code in Layout.on_show()
    
    Layout.on_close method MUST also be defined - though it can simply be a 1 line function containing pass. This is called when a layout is either closed
    or a child layout is opened. This method to save state.     
    
    Layouts also allow you to set "Layout" events through Layout.add_event() - you would typically use this for things like "back key press" or even for 
    other events which are accessible through the SL4A EventFacade's event system like sensor data. For catching these events, you would typically set
    EventHandler.compare_attribute to None.
    
    Layout events are internally handled by adding a special "layout" view to the views collection identified by a hashtag. You should not yourself
    access this special view.

    You SHOULD NOT instantiate a FullScreenWrapper2App but rather, simply call its class methods. To use the app, you first need to call FullScreenWrapper2App.initialize(android_instance) with the droid = android.Android() 
    object that you have created in you program. This is always subsequently accessible by FullScreenWrapper2App.get_android_instance()
    
    You can then call FullScreenWrapper2App.show_layout() and FullScreenWrapper2App.close_layout() to show and close layouts respectively. FullScreenWrapper2App places layouts in an internal stack. This lets the framework seamlessly handle 
    parent->show child->close child->show parent type of transitions simplifying your code. It also gives you a method to exit the app by calling FullScreenWrapper2App.exit_FullScreenWrapper2App() at any time. This internally works by signalling 
    the eventloop to terminate the loop by posting an internal event
    
    the internal function called by FullScreenWrapper2App.show_layout() and close_layout() actually populates the layout's views once it is shown & also calls the Layout.on_show() function
    
    Once you have called show_layout() and your first layout is displayed on screen with its view properties & event handlers set, you should call FullScreenWrapper2App.eventloop() to start the event loop. The event loop will keep polling for
    the event queue and dispatch events to the appropriate handler functions
