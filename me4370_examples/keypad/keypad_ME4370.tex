		For the keypad to work, you need to set the upper four bits of DDRA as output and the lower four bits as input (0xf0). If you then set PA4 high and PA5-PA7 low, you can see that the voltage across each button in the first row (buttons 0, 1, 2, and 3) is 0V. Therefore, PA0-PA3 are all low when no keys are pressed. Pressing any of the buttons in the first row will connect the pin corresponding to that button to PA4 which is high. If you pressed any of the keys not in the first row, you would be connecting the corresponding pin to low (PA5, PA6, or PA7), and you would not be able to detect the keypress. To detect keys in another row, you need to set PA4 low and set either PA5, PA6, or PA7 high. Setting more than one of PA4, PA5, PA6 or PA7 high would make it impossible to detect exactly which key is pressed since all the keys in a column are connected to a single pin.\\
